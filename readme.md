# Natours Project

Welcome to **Natours**, an advanced and feature-rich application for booking and managing tours across the U.S., developed using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**.

### 🌍 Project Overview

Natours is a full-stack application designed for tour management, featuring a RESTful API and server-rendered pages. The app is fully optimized, allowing users to explore, book, and manage tours with a seamless experience.
